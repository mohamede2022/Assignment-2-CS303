# Assignment-2 CS303

- Building a string-specific instance of the SingleLinkedList class. A list of string items will be managed using this.
**On the my_list, several operations are carried out:**
- Add "Matt" to the front of the list.
- Add "Bradley" to the front of the list.
- Add "Mahomes" to the end of the list.
- Add "Jaden" to the end of the list.
- Insert "Mohamed" at position 2 in the list.
- Display the first and last items in the list. In this case, it shows the items "Bradley" and "Jaden".
- Remove the first item from the list.
- Remove the last item from the list.
- Remove the item at position 2 (which is "Mohamed") from the list.
- Display the first and last items in the modified list. In this case, it shows the items "Matt" and "Mahomes".
- Attempt to find the string "Mohamed" in the list. Since "Mohamed" was removed earlier, this operation will not find "Mohamed." The result is stored in the index variable.
The code then checks if index is less than or equal to my_list.find("Mohamed") (which would be the number of items in the list if "Mohamed" were not found). It prints whether "Mohamed" was found in the list or not. In this case, it will print that "Mohamed was found in the list."

**The code then proceeds to "Part 2," which simulates professional and non-professional employees:**
- It creates an instance of a professional employee (Professional employeePro) and displays their weekly salary and weekly healthcare cost, as well as the vacation days they earned.
- It prompts the user to enter the number of hours worked by a non-professional employee (Nonprofessional employeeNon) and then displays their weekly salary, weekly healthcare cost, and the vacation days they earned.
- Then it finally exits the program.

In summary, the code demonstrates operations on a linked list of strings and includes a simulation of professional and non-professional employees with salary, healthcare cost, and vacation day calculations.
